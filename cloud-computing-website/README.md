To deploy this static website on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Create a new project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2. Connect your Git repository or upload the project files manually.
3. Ensure the root directory is set to the folder containing `index.html` (e.g., `cloud-computing-website`).
